\usage{
fitPredictiveModel(plpData, modelType = "logistic",
  removeDropoutsForLr = TRUE, cohortId = NULL, outcomeId = NULL,
  prior = createPrior("laplace", exclude = c(0), useCrossValidation = TRUE),
  control = createControl(noiseLevel = "silent", cvType = "auto",
  startingVariance = 0.1))
}
\arguments{
\item{plpData}{An object of type \code{plpData}.}

\item{modelType}{The type of predictive model. Options are "logistic", "poisson", and
"survival".}

\item{removeDropoutsForLr}{If TRUE and modelType is "logistic", subjects that do not have the full
observation window (i.e. are censored earlier) and do not have the outcome
are removed prior to fitting the model.}

\item{cohortId}{The ID of the specific cohort for which to fit a model.}

\item{outcomeId}{The ID of the specific outcome for which to fit a model.}

\item{prior}{The prior used to fit the model. See \code{\link[Cyclops]{createPrior}} for
details.}

\item{control}{The control object used to control the cross-validation used to determine the
                       hyperparameters of the prior (if applicable). See
                       \code{\link[Cyclops]{createControl}} for details.}
