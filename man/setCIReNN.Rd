\usage{
setCIReNN(units = c(128, 64), recurrentDropout = c(0.2),
  layerDropout = c(0.2), lr = c(1e-04), decay = c(1e-05),
  outcomeWeight = c(1), batchSize = c(100), epochs = c(100),
  earlyStoppingMinDelta = c(1e-04), earlyStoppingPatience = c(10),
  seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{units}{The number of units of RNN layer - as a list of vectors}

\item{recurrentDropout}{The reccurrent dropout rate (regularisation)}

\item{layerDropout}{The layer dropout rate (regularisation)}

\item{lr}{Learning rate}

\item{decay}{Learning rate decay over each update.}

\item{outcomeWeight}{The weight of the outcome class in the loss function}

\item{batchSize}{The number of data points to use per training batch}

\item{epochs}{Number of times to iterate over dataset}

\item{earlyStoppingMinDelta}{minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an improvement for early stopping, i.e. an absolute change of less than min_delta in loss of validation data, will count as no improvement.}

\item{earlyStoppingPatience}{Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.}

\item{seed}{Random seed used by deep learning model}
