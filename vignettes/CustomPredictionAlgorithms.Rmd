# Introduction

The `PatientLevelPrediction` package enables data extraction, model building, and model evaluation using data from databases that are translated into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). 

This vignette describes how you can add custom algorithms to the list of available algorithms in the `PatientLevelPrediction` package. This would allow you to fully leverage the standardize model development process with your own favourite algorithm.

Of course, we invite you to share your new algorithms with the community through the GitHub repository.
